I wanted to try out new technologies and see what I can do with some free time on my hands, consider it a challenge of sorts. I started off by making apps in Swift and putting them up on the app store, namely, Wordiste and Membermore. Both still a work in progress as they are just the manifestations of the core idea behind making each of them. I do keep updating them from time to time.</p>\n<p>Post this swift development sprint I turned my attention to the holy grail of front end technologies HTML, CSS and Javascript. I picked courses on Udemy and Stackskills and started putting the pieces together however it wasn’t until I started with nodeJS that I really got into it. This blog you’re reading is one of the outcomes of learning these technologies.</p>\n<p>I really did feel the thrill of the challenge and mysteries of the bugs I introduced along with the hidden tricks of these languages and technologies.</p>\n<p><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/26FLa6peMp3ZNzKnu/giphy.gif"></p>\n<p> What’s even more exciting is the fact that there is really no limit to this, which is scary I do admit but I presume that is the thrill of the chase and the challenge of life. Interesting domains such as Machine learning, AI and Deep Learning are what i’ll see to next.\nP.S. - I do remain an iOS faithful but it doesn’t hurt to branch out a bit :D</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Winter of 17",date:"December 01, 2017"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/winter-of-17/",previous:!1,next:!1}}}});
