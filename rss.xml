&lt;p&gt;So in the winter of 2017 I started out with a plan to hit the refresh button after developing for iOS for more than a year at a technology firm. I wanted to try out new technologies and see what I can do with some free time on my hands, consider it a challenge of sorts. I started off by making apps in Swift and putting them up on the app store, namely, Wordiste and Membermore. Both still a work in progress as they are just the manifestations of the core idea behind making each of them. I do keep updating them from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post this swift development sprint I turned my attention to the holy grail of front end technologies HTML, CSS and Javascript. I picked courses on Udemy and Stackskills and started putting the pieces together however it wasn’t until I started with nodeJS that I really got into it. This blog you’re reading is one of the outcomes of learning these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really did feel the thrill of the challenge and mysteries of the bugs I introduced along with the hidden tricks of these languages and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; What’s even more exciting is the fact that there is really no limit to this, which is scary I do admit but I presume that is the thrill of the chase and the challenge of life. Interesting domains such as Machine learning, AI and Deep Learning are what i’ll see to next.
P.S. - I do remain an iOS faithful but it doesn’t hurt to branch out a bit :D&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
